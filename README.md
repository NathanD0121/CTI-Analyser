# Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyser

A Python program that analyses posts from hacker forums on the dark web and identifies possible cyber threats. This leads to the creation of Cyber Threat Intelligene (CTI).

The dataset used in this project was the CrimeBB dataset from Cambridge Cybercrime Centre through a data sharing agreement with Birmingham City University. 

For the purpose of this GitHub repository a mock dataset has been created. This in no way resembles the dataset provided by Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, neither does it represent actual data regarding cyber threats. It is intended as to serve as an example that can be used to showcase how the analyser works.

This system was created as part of my Masters Project
